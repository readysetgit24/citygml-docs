# citygml-docs

Welcome to City GML docs! 

In this project, we bench mark common operations performed on 3D City Database, a 3D geo database to store, represent 
and manage 3d city models on top of a relational database.

This repository contains tutorials for GIS related software


The methodology for our querying CityGML is the following: 
1.  Set up PostGres, PostGis

2. Enable PostGis Extension into database
